## Synopsis

Common code for MATLAB toolboxes for Robotics, Machine Vision.  Supports argument parsing, plotting (points, lines, ellipses, circles, boxes, polygones), figures, animation, arrows, polygons, graphs and may  mathematical operations and datatypes.


## Code Example

```
>> about ans
ans [double] : 3x3 (72 bytes)
```

## Motivation

A collection of utility functions that factor out common tasks for the toolboxes.

## Installation

Relevant files are included in the distributions of Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB (RTB) and Machine Vision Toolbox for MATLAB (MVTB).

To use this, my development repo, directly:
  * clone this repo
  * clone RTB or MVTB
  * ensure that both are in your MATLAB path
  
## API Reference

Built as part of Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB or Machine Vision Toolbox for MATLAB.
